# Oesophageal cancer clinical and molecular stratification (OCCAMS) incorporating International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)

Oesophageal and junctional adenocarcinomas (OAC) have a poor prognosis and the standard of care is cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy followed by surgery. In contrast to other cancers, as yet knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of the disease has not been used to determine prognosis and therapy.

The OCCAMS (Oesophageal Cancer Clinical and Molecular Stratification) study is a network of clinical centres recruiting OAC patients for tissue collection. OAC patient data and tissue samples are used to attempt to identify clinical, demographic and molecular factors affecting disease progression.

## The aims of the OCCAMS study are to:
* Better characterise the clinico-demographic risk factors
* Characterise the molecular genetic landscape (DNA, RNA, epigenome)
* Determine disease sub-types and develop new clinically relevant classification systems
* Develop and validate improved clinical staging and prognostic algorithms
* Ascertain new therapeutic targets for clinical trials
